Q1: 
This is the way to init a socket and connect to a host and port
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, port))

Q2: A client socket send a request and receive a response
    A server socket listens to requests and accept it and send a response

Q3: We add socket.SO_REUSEADDR when we call setsockopt for the server socket
Q4: We get a connection socket, and an address from the code: conn, addr = s.accept()
Q5: We keep receiving data of 4096 packs until there are no more data to read
